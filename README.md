## My process

1. Started with the mobile design, then scaled up for tablets and desktops.
2. Structured components using a modular approach in React.
3. Styled using TailwindCSS with a focus on utility classes.
4. Added responsive image handling and transitions for polish.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – Utility-first CSS framework
- Flexbox & CSS Grid – For layout structure
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – JavaScript library for building UI
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) – Fast development build tool


### What I learned

- How to implement `picture` elements for responsive background images.
- Using Tailwind utility classes for fast prototyping and clean code.
- Creating reusable React components for scalable code..

### Continued development

- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
- Add animation to scroll interactions.
